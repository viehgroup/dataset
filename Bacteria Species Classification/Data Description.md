For this project, you will be predicting bacteria species based on repeated lossy measurements of DNA snippets. Snippets of length 10 are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy that calculates the histogram of bases in the snippet.

Each row of data contains a spectrum of histograms generated by repeated measurements of a sample, each row containing the output of all 286 histogram possibilities (e.g., A<sub>0</sub>T<sub>0</sub>G<sub>0</sub>C<sub>10</sub> to A<sub>10</sub>T<sub>0</sub>G<sub>0</sub>C<sub>0</sub>), which then has a bias spectrum (of totally random ATGC) subtracted from the results. The data (both train and test) also contains simulated measurement errors (of varying rates) for many of the samples, which makes the problem more challenging.

<h2>Files</h2>

- **train.csv** - the training set, which contains the spectrum of 10-mer histograms for each sample
- **test.csv** - the test set; your task is to predict the bacteria species (target) for each row_id


Best of Luck!
